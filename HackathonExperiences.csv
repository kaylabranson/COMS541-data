Hackathons are not exactly Goldman Sachs, but when white people are trying to be ""inclusive,"" it ends up being patronizing and assumes that the initial structural order of power is alright.

A friend volunteering at the event at the time said the organizers had more food than they were distributing. At the end of the event the organizers gave out boxes of granola bars, meanwhile during the event people were ordering pizza and other food since there wasn't enough at the hackathon. That left a really bad taste in my mouth.

This is my least favorite part because all-nighters wreck havoc on my body (so doing well in classes the next week is much harder) so I'm much less likely to go to hackathons without clear sleeping arrangements.","I'd like to see more interdisciplinary hackathons- which I've started to see and I'm excited about.","",""
